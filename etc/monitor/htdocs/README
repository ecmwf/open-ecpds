The jsp files in the jsp directory are used by the struts tiles framework. They aren't
complete pages by themselves and are not accessed directly by name.

Please check:
- WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml:		For the page definitions.
- WEB-INF/struts-config.xml:	For the path mappings leading to these definitions.
