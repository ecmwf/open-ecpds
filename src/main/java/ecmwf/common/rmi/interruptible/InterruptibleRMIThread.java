/**
 * Extends Thread to provide support for interrupting the thread while the
 * thread is in a blocking RMI IO operation. Typically, threads that are in
 * blocking IO operations can't be interrupted. This implementation provides a
 * mechanism for an RMI client socket (created by
 * {@link org.neilja.net.interruptiblermi.InterruptibleRMISocketFactory#createSocket(String, int)}
 * ) to register when it enters blocking IO. When {@link #interrupt()} is called
 * on this thread, the associated RMI socket is shutdown and closed, thus
 * terminating the blocking IO operation. Use
 * {@link org.neilja.net.interruptiblermi.InterruptibleRMIThreadFactory#newThread(Runnable)}
 * to create instances of this thread class.
